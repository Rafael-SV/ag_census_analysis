# ag_census_analysis

This is a 2 month long project started at the end of october. 

In order to predict the best ways a new Ag tech startup can market to earlyvangelist farmers, the growers most likely to adopt new technology need to be identified.
This project will take change in crop type in an area as a proxy for willingness of the local farmers to try new technology.

I am going to cluster areas based on crop types, then figure out which areas change the most. Finally, I will build a classifier to predict what type of area new places are. 

This repo contains some analysis of United States Department of Agriculture census data. The USDA ag census occurs every 5 years.
The data can be downloaded from here: ftp://ftp.nass.usda.gov/quickstats/
